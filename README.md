About us:
Text Analytics Research is a group of researchers working in the area of text analytics,
information systems, scientometrics and artificial intelligence. The group also maintains
a Text Analytics Laboratory based at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India (www.bhu.ac.in).
The group members include faculty members, post doctoral researchers, doctoral researchers,
few masters students and some collaborators from India and abroad. We are largely involved 
in academic and research activities (which are mostly not for profit). However, we are also 
open to consulting activities as per needs of different organizations.
